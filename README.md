# About Fleckit
Julia code to generate speckled images for digital image correlation studies. The image below shows the speckle types currently supported. Image A shows Perlin noise based speckling, which is a pixelated image containing continuous gray scales. Image B, C, and D show speckles created as polygons in an `.svg` image description.
